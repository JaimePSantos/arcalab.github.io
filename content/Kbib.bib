	abstract = {This paper describes the application of the IVY workbench to the formal analysis of a user interface for a safety-critical aerospace system. The operation manual of the system was used as a requirement document, and this made it possible to build a reference model of the user interface, focusing on navigation between displays, the information provided by each display, and how they are interrelated. Usability-related property specification patterns were then used to derive relevant properties for verification. This paper discusses both the modeling strategy and the analytical results found using the IVY workbench. The purpose of the reference model is to provide a standard against which future versions of the interface may be assessed.},

	url = {http://www.di.uminho.pt/~jfc/publications/HarrisonMC18-IEEETSE-postprint.pdf},
	volume = {45},
	year = {2019},
	abstract = {The paper describes templates for model-based analysis of usability and safety aspects of user interface software design. The templates crystallize general usability principles commonly addressed in user-centred safety requirements, such as the ability to undo user actions, the visibility of operational modes, and the predictability of user interface behavior. These requirements have standard forms across different application domains, and can be instantiated as properties of specific devices. The modeling and analysis process is carried out using the Prototype Verification System (PVS), and is further facilitated by structuring the specification of the device using a format that is designed to be generic across interactive systems. A concrete case study based on a commercial infusion pump is used to illustrate the approach. A detailed presentation of the automated verification process using PVS shows how failed proof attempts provide precise information about problematic user interface software features.},

	url = {http://www.di.uminho.pt/~jfc/publications/Campos20-TOCHI-author.pdf},
	volume = {27},
	year = {2020},
	abstract = {Use error due to user interface design defects is a major concern in many safety critical domains, for example avionics and healthcare. Early detection of latent user interface problems can be facilitated by user centered design methods that integrate formal verification technologies. This paper considers the role that formal verification technologies can play in the context of user centered design by considering three existing tools: CIRCUS, PVSio-web, and IVY. These tools have been developed to support the model based analysis of critical user interfaces. They have their foundations in existing formal verification technologies, but each of them is focused towards particular issues relating to user interface design. The paper explores the different phases of the user centered design process and the extent to which each of these tools supports these phases. Criteria are developed for assessing their role at each stage of the design process. The results of the evaluation provide guidance to developers to help choose the most appropriate tool based on their analysis needs while at the same time setting challenges for future developments.},
